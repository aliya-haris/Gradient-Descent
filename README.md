# Gradient-Descent

# Introduction
This project explores the application of gradient descent to determine the optimal fertilizer amount for increased crop yield. Utilizing Microsoft Excel, the gradient descent algorithm was implemented to understand the functionality behind minimizing the loss function.

# Methodology
The methodology involved the following steps:

1. Arrange dependent and independent variables, ensuring correlation.
2. Define the hypothesis function and loss function.
3. Calculate derivatives of the loss function to tune parameters.
4. Update parameters using the gradient descent algorithm with a specified learning rate.
5. Repeat steps for each newly tuned set of parameters to minimize the loss function.
